%% Baseline attenuation: Highpass filter on the PPG and accelerometer signals
% For the PPG signal we do not want to filter out the heart rate. Considering
% a minimal physiological heart rate of 30 bpm (0.5 Hz), we can use a highpass
% filter at 0.5 Hz. For the accelerometer norm signal, we do not want to filter
% out the frequencies of rhythmic motion. Considering a very slow walking pace
% of 1 step/s (1 Hz), the frequency of the arm swinging movement is half of 
% that frequency, i.e. 0.5 Hz, and therefore we can use the same filter as for
% the PPG signal.
fs = 25;
[b,a] = butter(2, 0.5/(fs/2), 'high');
ppg = filtfilt(b, a, ppg);
accn = filtfilt(b, a, accn);

%% Spectrogram of the PPG & accelerometer norm signals
% When running, or when suddenly stopping an intense exercise, the heart rate
% can change quite fast in matter of a few seconds. A window of 10 seconds 
% would be short enough at all times to consider the signal stationary in the
% window. However, a slightly longer window, e.g. 20 seconds, will also be fine
% the vast majority of the time, with the advantage of improving the frequency
% resolution of our spectrogram. It is therefore a good choice.
window = round(20*fs);          % Windows of 20 seconds
noverlap = round(0.95*20*fs);   % Overlap of 95%
