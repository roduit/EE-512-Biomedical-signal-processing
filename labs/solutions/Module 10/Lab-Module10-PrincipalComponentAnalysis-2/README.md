# pca-lab
Lab session on principal component analysis (PCA).

## Instructions
- Please **submit** your **report** as a **single PDF** file.
- We recommend working in **groups of 3 students**; the last group can be a group of 2 or 4.
- You can **prepare one single report** for the group (*name1_name2_name3_lab_PCA.pdf*), but **every member needs to upload** the same file individually.
- There are **2 experiments** in this practical session. The **Python** code for each experiment is already coded and will be provided as **Jupyter notebooks**. These will only **require minimal input** from you. A major part of this practical session is thus focused on questions testing your understanding and correct interpretation of the signals and the analysis results that you see.
